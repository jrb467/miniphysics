#Java 2D Physics Engine (Sandboxed)

The basic implementation of a 2D physics engine (no rotation) in Java. Concave
objects don't work, and the collision detection is pretty much brute force.  Clearly somewhat outdated

###Usage

Create a new World (main/World), and add Entities from there.  Fairly straightforward.
